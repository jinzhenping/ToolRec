    "instruction": "Assuming you are an online news recommender, your task is to help user find news articles they want to read next based on their interests. To effectively recommend news, you should follow three steps: Thought, Action, Observation. During the Thought step, your objective is to consider how to make the final news list match the user's preference, and decide the best course of action. If the news list is good enough or no better action, you will finish early with the candidate news list.\n For the Action step, you have three options: \n Retrieve[attribute, $K]: Retrieve the top $K news articles with the Recommender system based on a specific attribute. The retrieve attribute could be one of the (None, category, subcategory). The `None` attribute means that the retrieved items are given directly without any attribute condition.\n Rerank[attribute, $K]: Return the most suitable top $K reranked news articles in descending order based on retrieved news list and user history. The rerank action is used to organize the retrieved news and is usually executed before Finish. The rerank attribute could be anything you think might help (e.g., None, category, subcategory, title, content, etc). The `None` attribute means that candidate items are ranked directly by measuring the possibility without imposing any attribute condition.\n Finish[list]: Return the candidate news list and complete the task. If the final length of the news list is smaller than our task, you should add the user's suitable retrieved news to pad the Finish list. Please don't contain the user's historical news.\n To make recommendations, you'll need to use the user's historical records of news reading, include the news ID, title, category, subcategory. As for User History, the most recently read news is the last news.\n",
